# 3D Scene Project – OpenGL  

## Project Overview  
This project involved designing and developing a 3D scene in OpenGL. My scene included four objects—a table, candle, mug, and book—each textured with realistic materials (wood, wax, leather, ceramic). I implemented camera controls (Q/E for vertical movement, scroll wheel for velocity adjustment) and experimented with ambient and point lighting to simulate realistic effects.

## Design Approach  

### How do I approach designing software?  
I approach software design by breaking down a project into smaller, manageable components and focusing on functionality first, followed by refinement. For this project, that meant deciding on the objects I wanted in the scene and then layering in transformations, textures, and lighting.  

### What new design skills did I develop?  
I gained experience in designing object layouts with scaling, rotation, and translation. I also learned how lighting design impacts mood and how textures can add realism.  

### What design process did I follow?  
I followed an iterative process:  
1. Define the objects and their shapes.  
2. Apply transformations to place them naturally in the scene.  
3. Add textures to enhance realism.  
4. Experiment with lighting for atmosphere.  

### How can these tactics apply to future work?  
This approach can apply to game development, UI/UX, or visualization projects—starting simple, then refining through iterative adjustments for usability and realism.

## Development Approach  

### How do I approach developing programs?  
I take a modular approach: building core features, testing them individually, and then integrating them into the full project.  

### What new development strategies did I use?  
I used shader-based material and texture management for the first time and integrated user controls for interactivity.  

### How did iteration factor into development?  
Iteration was essential—I tested each object and control individually, refined scaling and positioning, and reworked the lighting multiple times to get closer to the effect I wanted.  

### How has my approach evolved?  
Across milestones, my coding evolved from basic shape rendering to more advanced material handling and user input. By the final project, I was more comfortable debugging shaders and organizing code into reusable components.

## Connection to Goals  

### How can computer science help me reach my goals?  
Computer science provides problem-solving skills, technical knowledge, and the ability to create interactive systems—skills that align with my goals in software engineering and data analysis.  

### Educational Pathway  
Computational graphics taught me how to design, build, and optimize 3D environments. These skills expand my knowledge base for future classes, especially in interactive systems, visualization, or game development.  

### Professional Pathway  
Visualization and graphics can be applied in fields like cybersecurity (3D network simulations), logistics (visualizing warehouse flows), or software development (interactive UI/UX). The ability to design interactive, data-driven visuals is highly transferable across industries.
